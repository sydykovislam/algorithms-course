## Description
This course covers basics topics of algorithms: recursive functions, quick sort and binary search, speed of algorighms.

There are images and diagrams to visually explain a complicated things:

And of course lessons contain code implementations of these concepts and their explanation:

The course is quite understandable, because it uses visual examples of the programming concepts and only then dives students into code implementation.
